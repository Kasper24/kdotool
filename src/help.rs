    kdotool [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS] [COMMAND [ARGS]]...

Options:
    -h, --help         Show this help
    -v, --version      Show program version
    -d, --debug        Enable debug output
    -n, --dry-run      Don't actually run the script. Just print it to stdout.

    --shortcut SHORTCUT [--name NAME]
        Register a shortcut to run the script.
        Optionally set a name for the shortcut, so you can remove it later.

Window Query Commands:
    search [OPTIONS] PATTERN    
        Search for windows with titles, names, or classes matching a regular
        expression pattern.

        The default options are --name --class --classname --role (unless you
        specify one or more of --name, --class, --classname, or --role).

        OPTIONS:
        --class
            Match against the window class.
        --classname
            Match against the window classname.
        --role
            Match against the window role.
        --name
            Match against the window name. This is the same string that is
            displayed in the window titlebar.
        --id
            Match windows that belong to a specific id.
        --pid PID
            Match windows that belong to a specific process id. This may not
            work for some X applications that do not set this metadata on its
            windows.
        --screen NUMBER (KDE 5 only)
            Select windows only on a specific screen. Default is to search all

            all desktops.
        --limit NUMBER
            Stop searching after finding NUMBER matching windows. The default
            is no search limit (which is equivalent to '--limit 0')
        --all
            Require that all conditions be met.
        --any
            Match windows that match any condition (logically, 'or'). This is
